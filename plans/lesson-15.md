# Midterm Reflections and Intro to Markup

**Work to have done**:

* Your final-for-now Visual Rhetorical Collage and Reflection
* Download and install the [Atom text editor](http://atom.io)

**Plan for the day**:

1. Midterm reflection (5-10 min)
2. Web-design unit overview and assignment (10 min)
3. Markup: separating content from display (10-15 min)
4. "Web Design in 4 Minutes"... in 15 minutes
5. Homework preview

## Midterm reflection (5-10 min)

Welcome to the second half of the semester!

<div class="alert alert-success">
<!-- NOTE FOR NEXT TIME: use this reflection as a chance to think about similarities/differences across the media of sound and visual space. What's afforded differently? What strategies connect the two? -->
Over the weekend, you wrote a reflection on your visual-rhetorical project; now, take a few minutes to write a broader reflection on the semester as a whole. Given your goals and expectations when you began this class, what have you begun to learn, and what, especially, haven't you begun to learn? <strong>What skills do you want to have practiced before the semester is over?</strong> Can you think of any projects you might compose over the next month or so that would help you get that practice?
</div>

Take 5-10 minutes. I won't collect these directly, but you will use them to develop your pitch for a collaborative project, and as a snapshot of your progress to look back on in a final reflection for the end of the course.

## 2. Web-design unit overview and assignment (10 min)

As I explained in the syllabus, your third project is to **build a responsive website using basic html and css files** — as opposed to a site manager like WordPress or Wix — **along with any media assets you wish to embed.** In assigning this, I have two main goals for you:

1. to learn how to manage a composite project made up of multiple interlinking files, and
2. to explore the affordances of the web design stack as a medium, and especially its ability to _flexibly render content for multiple audiences or reading priorities_.

Let's read through this together.

<!-- Go through overview, constraints, deadlines. -->

## 3. Markup: separating content from display (10-15 min)

HTML = HyperText Markup Language
CSS = Cascading Style Sheets

What does that mean??

Here's a nice [introduction](http://web.archive.org/web/20190213002132/https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/introduction/#html-css-and-javascript).

<!-- Make the connection to their own markup on the Issue Queue: bold, italic, etc. -->

Let's look at what that separation allows. Come with me to the [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com).

## 4. "Web Design in 4 Minutes"... in 15 minutes

Because time-in-class is short, and because we have a wide range of web design experience among us, I'm going to accelerate past the beginning for a moment. In the process, we'll see examples of some of the essential things you can *do* with CSS – but we'll skip over the breadth of information you'd need to build something like this from scratch. My hope is that, having been to the top of the mountain, you'll have a better sense of why it's worth trekking across the desert of the tutorials to get back up there on your own two <del>feet</del> typing hands.

I expect this will take a bit more than four minutes, because I fully plan to interject, and I hope you will, too. But that's really what this is called:

## Homework for Next Time

* **Do** as much of the [Interneting is Hard (but it doesn't have to be)](http://web.archive.org/web/20190213013947/https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/) tutorial as you can – at least parts 1-4 (from "Introduction" through "Hello, CSS")
* **Show your work** by pushing your tutorial code to a repository
   - I've already created folders for parts 1-3 in the GH repo you just forked; clone it to your local computer, and you should be able to work in those folders and push.
* **Bring** headphones for sonic isolation: we'll have studio time next class.
