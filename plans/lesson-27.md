# Intro to Final Portfolio; Final Twine Studio

**Work to have done**: Almost-but-not-quite-ready group Twine

**Plan for the Day**:

1. Prompt for Final Portfolio and Final Reflection
2. Final class preview
3. Studio!

## 1. Prompt for Final Portfolio and Final Reflection (10-15 min)

Please take the [handout](/{{site.course.base_path}}/uploads/handout--final-portfolio-prompt.docx).

Let's go over this together so you can ask questions as they come up.

## 2. Final class preview

Next class is our last class, believe it or not. Please be ready to share something you admired about a classmate's project – from any unit – or something that stuck with you from feedback you received.

To help you in that process, I'm going to give back the cards you _wrote_ during workshop; I trust you've already got photos of the cards you received.

After that gifting, we're going to spend some time playing through each other's final Twine games. : )

## 3. Studio!

Do whatever you need to do to get yourselves to a **finished, playable product by midnight tonight.** Note that this may mean finally sacrificing some stretch goal you'd previously set for yourselves, so as not to overpromise and underdeliver in the game itself.
