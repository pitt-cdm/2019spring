# Visual Unit WORKSHOP

**Work to have done**: a complete-as-possible draft of your visual rhetorical collages, shared where we can find it, with a


**Plan for the day**:

1. Workflow Reminder: Describe -> Evaluate -> Suggest (5 min)
2. Evaluation reminder: our shared criteria (5 min)
3. Peer Review Workshop (3 times 10-12 min)
4. Evaluation revisited (10 min)
5. HW Preview


## 1. Workflow Reminder: Describe -> Evaluate -> Suggest (5 min)

<!-- This is the same process as last time, but not everyone was doing it. Please do try: it helps make your comments more concrete and actionable. It's great to like something, but if you can't say *what* you liked, the creator can't build on that knowledge as effectively... and *you* may not be learning as much as you could by giving that comment. -->

To help maximize what you learn both in receiving _and in giving_ feedback, please work in the following three steps:

<div class="alert alert-info">
<ol><li> First, <strong>describe</strong> what you see, without judging whether it's good or not. What is this project? What stands out? What seems to be the focus? <!-- Help learn how the eye is drawn. Test whether the audience is getting the main point you want to get across. --></li>
<li>Next, <strong>evaluate</strong> according to shared criteria, in light of the focus you perceive in the project. <!-- This is still a form of description: it's not about "good" or "bad" in the abstract but about where it meets or misses the shared or stated goals. --></li>
<li>Finally, <strong>suggest</strong> some revision possibility that you think might help take the project to the next level: assume a revision is on the way. Given the goals, the focus, the criteria, what might be next? <!-- Pose this as a suggestion, not a command: and _interpret_ these as suggestions, not commands. --></li>
</ol>
</div>

<!-- If possible, I'd like to give back your index cards, not from the comments you *received*, but the comments you *gave*. Read them over. Are you doing describe/evaluate/suggest? Or not? If not, strive to level up today. -->

## 2. Evaluation reminder: our criteria (5 min)
We set up a few [shared goals and constraints](http://bit.ly/miller2019spring) to meet the baseline requirements. Let's try to help everyone get at least to there!

<!--
**Baseline criteria**
For a minimum grade of B, all projects for this unit must:

* Use arrangement, size, color, visual rhythm, and/or contrast to focus viewers' attention.
* Include at least one word, with a carefully chosen font, as explained in reflection.
* Have a clear message or intervention
* Incorporate juxtaposition
* Use at least 3 layers
* Use at least 2 GIMP tools, and write about them in the reflection
* Aim for surprise or metaphorical leap in the elements you bring together.
* Argue in reflection why you did what you did
-->

I'd like to point out two things we _didn't_ say, but I think maybe were going without saying:

* Use only source material you have fair rights to use (and cite where appropriate)
* Use at least one GIMP tool to edit an image (modify the image in any way)

Can we confirm these, or does someone want to make a strong argument against?


## 3. Peer Review Workshop (3 times 10-12 min)

Let's do this!
<div class="alert alert-success">
Before you leave your seat, (1) load up your GIMP project, and (2) <strong>label three</strong> index cards <em>For: {yourname}</em>.
</div>
Then...
<div class="alert alert-success">
Rotate *counter*-clockwise around the monitor-islands. Label <em>one</em> index card <strong>From: {yourname}</strong>. View / read through the project fully at least once, then
<ol><li><strong>Describe</strong> what you see,</li> <li><strong>Evaluate</strong> where it meets or misses the criteria,</li> and <li><strong>Suggest</strong> ways to meet and exceed the criteria!</li></ol>
</div>

I'll keep track of time.

On subsequent loops, note that **after** viewing the project first, you may also want to read and/or refer to the previous index cards.

## 4. Evaluation revisited (10 min)
Head back to your seats and take a minute to read **and photograph** the notes you've received. (Make sure your photos are legible; I'll be collecting the cards at the end of class.)

Based on your viewing, would anyone like to propose new criteria, whether baseline or aspirational?


# Homework for Next Time

* Next class will be a graphic designers' studio: **bring headphones for [sonic isolation](http://noisli.com)**, and whatever else you need to work towards finalizing your visual rhetorical collage.
  - The final draft is due at the end of the day on Sunday, and a reflection by class-time on Tuesday; see the [visual rhetorical collage prompt](https://github.com/pitt-cdm/visual-rhetoric-prompt/) for further details.
* Even as we zoom in toward the unit finale (again), I want to keep one eye open toward the bigger picture (again!). **Write a short blog post** thinking about possible group projects you'd like to try for the end of term.
  - What games or branching narratives come to mind as you view the class's arguments?
  - Or what further possibilities of graphic design might you want to explore in connection with other people, and other media?
  - You can post this to the [Issue Queue](https://github.com/pitt-cdm/miller2019spring/issues/10); there is no minimum length requirement.



## EXT:
If time remains, go ahead and get started on those revisions!
