# Sound Workshop

**Work to have done**: a complete-as-possible draft of your soundscape narratives

**Plan for the day**:

1. Describe -> Evaluate -> Suggest: A Workshop Workflow (5 min)
2. Evaluation reminder: our criteria (5 min)
3. Peer Review Workshop (3 times 10-12 min)
4. Evaluation revisited (10 min)
5. HW Preview


## 1. Describe -> Evaluate -> Suggest: A Workshop Workflow (5 min)

Today is all about getting _feedback_ for your projects. What does that metaphor mean? It's a process by which the output is picked up again as input. You've brought in your output so far; now you're going to learn by getting input from your audience.

<!-- A lot of peer review fails because it falls to one of two extremes: noncommittal nods, or non-stop nitpicking. Neither really takes advantage of the output we have in front of us. -->

To avoid some of the pitfalls of peer review, I'm going to insist that you provide this feedback in three steps:
<div class="alert alert-info">
<ol><li> First, <strong>describe</strong> what you hear, without judging whether it's good or not. What is this project? What stands out? What seems to be the focus? <!-- A lot of times as writers, even soundwriters, we don't even know if our audience is getting the main point we want to get across.  --></li>
<li>Next, <strong>evaluate</strong> according to some shared criteria, in light of the focus you perceive in the project. <!-- This is still a form of description: it's not about "good" or "bad" in the abstract but about where it meets or misses the shared or stated goals. --></li>
<li>Finally, <strong>suggest</strong> some revision possibility that you think might help take the project to the next level: assume a revision is on the way. Given the goals, the focus, the criteria, what might be next? <!-- Pose this as a suggestion, not a command: and interpret these as suggestions, not commands. --></li>
</ol>
</div>

We're going to be doing this all on index cards, which don't give you a ton of space: try to focus your response on what seems most important to the piece. (I'll ask you to photograph the cards for your records, then turn them in so I can get an overall sense of where we are as a group.)

## 2. Evaluation reminder: our criteria (5 min)
We set up a few [shared goals and constraints](http://bit.ly/miller2019spring) to meet the baseline requirements. Let's try to help everyone get at least to there!
> * Have something change from the beginning to the end of the piece
> * Play for 2-4 minutes
> * Have three layers (tracks) of sound overlapping at least once in the file
> * Contain at least 1 minute of original recordings by you or your classmates.
> * Contain at least one sound originally recorded by you.

<!-- missing from the list:
* Convey a sense of place
* Use only source material you have fair rights to use (and cite where appropriate)
-->

We also have some stretch goals, or aspirations. In offering suggestions, these are some (but not the only) good targets to aim for!
> * Transitions occur at meaningful points in the narrative (e.g. the musicâ€™s volume and alignment occur together)
> * Incorporate ~mystery sound~
> * Use Audacity's effects menu
> * Have more overlap (either in more places, or more tracks)

## 3. Peer Review Workshop (3 times 10-12 min)

Let's do this!
<div class="alert alert-success">
Before you leave your seat, (1) load up your Audacity project, (2) plug in your headphones, and (3) label **three** index cards <em>For: {yourname}</em>.
</div>
Then...
<div class="alert alert-success">
Rotate clockwise around the monitor-islands. Label <strong>one</strong> index card <em>From: {yourname}</em>. Listen to the project fully at least once, then (1) <strong>Describe</strong> what you hear, (2) <strong>Evaluate</strong> where it meets or misses the criteria, (3) <strong>Suggest</strong> ways to meet and exceed the criteria!
</div>

I'll keep track of time.

<!-- On subsequent loops, note that you may also want to read and/or refer to the previous index cards... **after** listening to the project first. -->

## 4. Evaluation revisited (10 min)
Head back to your seats and take a minute to read **and photograph** the notes you've received. (Make sure your photos are legible; I'll be collecting the cards at the end of class.)

Based on your listening, would anyone like to propose new criteria, whether baseline or aspirational?


# Homework for Next Time

* **Next class will be a sound-writers' studio:** bring headphones and whatever else you need to work towards finalizing your soundscape narrative.
  - The final draft is due at the end of the day on Sunday, and a reflection by class-time on Tuesday; see the [soundscape prompt](https://github.com/pitt-cdm/soundscape-prompt/) for further details.
* Even as we zoom in toward the unit finale, I want to keep one eye open toward the bigger picture. **Write a short blog post** thinking about possible group projects you'd like to try for the end of term.
  - What games or branching narratives come to mind as you listen to the class's soundscapes?
  - Or what further possibilities of sound might you want to explore in connection with other people, and other media?
  - You can post this to the [Issue Queue](https://github.com/pitt-cdm/miller2019spring/issues/5); there is no minimum length requirement.



## EXT:
If time remains, go ahead and get started on those revisions!
