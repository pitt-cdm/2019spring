## Plan for the day

1. GitHub for Poets review

3. What Git does better than GitHub
4. Very Brief Intro to the Command Line: going behind the scenes (but the usual scenes)


# 1. GitHub for Poets review (25 min)

**Take 5 minutes or so to write on your own**, from memory, about the videos you watched over the weekend: what stands out? what do you take away? what are you left wondering?

**In pairs, compare your impressions.** Help each other with your questions; be ready to share remaining questions or big takeaways. Spend another 5-8 minutes here.

*EXT: How well do you think GitHub can track Word files? Try it on one of your own repositories and see what happens if you upload two different versions of the same file.*

Okay, so **back to full-class discussion.** What stands out?

# 2. First project: Soundscape Narrative
