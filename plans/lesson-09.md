# Can You Picture It? Visual Rhetorics and Argument

**Work to have achieved**:

* A final-for-now version of your soundscape narratives
* Write and [post](https://github.com/pitt-cdm/miller2019spring/issues/2) reflection on same
* Download and install [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/), the Gnu Image Manipulation Program

**Plan for the day**:

1. Visual unit overview and assignment
2. Introduction to GIMP
3. Practice time


## Visual unit overview and assignment

As I explained in the syllabus, your second project is to **make a rhetorical claim through the juxtaposition of images and text.** It's kind of a collage, but a collage with an argument to make. In assigning this, I have two main goals for you:

1. to learn how to capture images and arrange them using digital tools, and
2. to explore the affordances of still images as a medium, and especially their ability to _direct attention_ and _help make ideas memorable_.

Let's read through this together.

<!-- Go through overview, constraints, deadlines. -->

## Examples

I've started pinning some examples of the kinds of collages and collisions I have in mind, but don't take this as expressing some absolute sense of range:

## Our Tool of Choice: GIMP

(It stands for [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU) Image Manipulation Program.)

I'll demo, using Beverly & Pack. "Fly Me to the Moon, by Way of a Hot Air Balloon."" 7 Sept. 2009. Flickr, https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkadog/3897126692/.

Points to hit:
* Single window mode
* Lots of selection tools
   - Quick Mask to help see what's currently selected
* Pay attention to the tiny text at the bottom
<!--* Extracting objects from background. Inverse select-->
* Layers! Of course layers

<div class="alert alert-info">
If you get stuck: <a href="https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/gimp-getting-unstuck.html">Chapter 4: Getting Unstuck</a> (and other resources on the <a href="{{site.course.base_path}}resources">resources page</a>
</div>

* Clone tool; tool settings window
* Scale effects. Rasters vs. vectors


## Your turn!

<div class="alert alert-success">
Take the image you posted way back in week 1, as part of our <a href="https://github.com/pitt-cdm/miller2019spring/issues/1">greetings and salutations</a>, and <strong>change something</strong>: change eye or hair (or fur) color, add a silly hat, insert loltext, etc. Have fun with it!
</div>

Take the time now to _practice adding and subtracting to a selection_ using the various tools, because that's what you'll need before you can use any of the other effects.

To fill with color, try the Bucket tool.

## EXT: Google Image's Advanced Search Tools

Not everything is just available for any use – even if you can find it on a public website. See my FAQ from last year at https://cdm2017.majoringinmeta.net/lesson-04/#key-questions-and-considerations-20-30-min.

# Homework for next time:
* **Read** the following short lessons on graphic design, by independent designer Julie Thompson: <a href="https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-positive-and-negative-space">positive and negative space</a>; <a href="https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-dominancehierarchy">dominance and hierarchy</a>; <a href="https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-rhythm-and-movement">rhythm and movement</a>.
* **Find and photograph** at least one example of a visual or graphic design out in "the wild" that makes some sort of claim, or argument.
   - By "in the wild," I mean that I expect you to come across some in the course of your daily routine. That said, if you need to search more actively, so be it.
   - The claim or argument could be explicit or implicit.
* **Write** a short blog post, sharing your visual argument example. Examine it through the lenses of positive/negative, dominance/hierarchy, and rhythm/movement: what does that help you see? Would you say this is effectively designed for making its argument? (NB: If the argument is implicit, please try to articulate what you think it's claiming.)
   - Post this to the issue queue, under ["Visual Arguments are Everywhere"](https://github.com/pitt-cdm/miller2019spring/issues/8).
