# Can You Picture It? Visual Rhetorics and Argument

**Work to have achieved**

* A final-for-now version of your soundscape narratives
* A reflection on same

## Homework for next time:
* **Read** the following short lessons on graphic design, by independent designer Julie Thompson: <a href="https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-positive-and-negative-space">positive and negative space</a>; <a href="https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-dominancehierarchy">dominance and hierarchy</a>; <a href="https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-rhythm-and-movement">rhythm and movement</a>.
* **Find and photograph** at least one example of a visual or graphic design out in "the wild" that makes some sort of claim, or argument.
   - By "in the wild," I mean that I expect you to come across some in the course of your daily routine. That said, if you need to search more actively, so be it.
   - The claim or argument could be explicit or implicit.
* **Write** a short blog post, sharing your visual argument example. Examine it through the lenses of positive/negative, dominance/hierarchy, and rhythm/movement: what does that help you see? Would you say this is effectively designed for making its argument? (NB: If the argument is implicit, please try to articulate what you think it's claiming.)
   - Post this to the issue queue, under ["Visual Arguments are Everywhere"](https://github.com/pitt-cdm/miller2019spring/issues/8).
