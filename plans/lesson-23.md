# Grouping Up and Setting Out

**Work to have done**: [pitched and read pitches](https://github.com/pitt-cdm/miller2019spring/issues/14) for collaborative projects – which it turns out will all be in Twine; skim through the [Twine 2 wiki](http://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:guide)

**Plan for the Day**:

1. Finalize Doodle poll, groups.
2. Read about and discuss collaborative workflow options in general <!-- W/D 114-115 -->
3. Set up group repos <!-- Ben: pre-create group assignment repos for them to join. Include workflow demo (md at least, maybe gif or gifs. Maybe a Twine storyboard as flow chart!) in the repo. -->
4. Walk through collaborative workflow pattern in GitHub <!-- pull, import, work, Publish to File, add, commit, push -->
5. Make a plan with your group! <!-- encourage them to use task list. exchange phone numbers or other best contact info. Write it up as a proposal, i.e. get a head start on the homework! -->


## 1. Finalize Doodle poll, groups.
<!-- What we actually did, and I think it worked fairly well: project the poll, and invite everyone to use that information to talk to each other about what projects to work on. Claim categories up on the whiteboard by writing down the names of group members. Think: trading floor.-->

If you haven't yet done so, please do register your votes in the [Doodle Poll](https://doodle.com/poll/a5cckbssaiyz8p6r). I'd be grateful if you were willing to do some of the projects that *don't* already have too many people... but if we need to do multiple versions of some starting points, I'm sure it'll be interesting to see how they vary.

For reasons of logistics and participation, I do want to keep the teams at 2-4 people, not more.

As these finalize, I'll write them on the board.

## 2. Read about and discuss collaborative workflow options in general
<!-- FOR NEXT TIME: Move this down; first walk through the assignment and the collaboration workflow, including a mention of merge-conflict avoidance strategies. Pass around the handout as part of the PROPOSAL.md assignment. -->
While you're waiting, take a handout; it's a short [scan from _Writer/Designer_](https://pitt.box.com/s/96l347yyrx2e69lkx635bl0jac4beaye) on collaborative workflow options.

If you have a group, discuss in your group! If not, read on your own.

Consider: what are your gifts, and what are your gaps? How might _you_ prefer to collaborate on this upcoming project?


## 3. Set up group repos

<div class="alert alert-white">
Now that we have groups, go sit with your group members!
</div>

I've set up some base files again, which you can access at the link below. Before you go there, **choose one person from your group to _create_ the team**<!-- e.g. the person whose name is listed first on the board -->; once they've done that, the others will **_join_** the team.

<div class="text-center">
<a href="https://classroom.github.com/g/6F7HZC0t">https://classroom.github.com/g/6F7HZC0t</a>
</div>

Let's see what's in the repo:

* a README.md you should probably rename at some point
* a how-to folder, with its own .md file explaining how GitHub's going to help with the collaboration.
* a playable Twine game walking you through the collaborative workflow

## 4. Walk through collaborative workflow pattern in GitHub
<!-- FOR NEXT TIME: Everyone clone. Have the first "driver" create a title page: include the name of the project as a level one header and their own name as a byline. Then publish/add/commit/push and have the next person pull/import and append their own name to the byline. Repeat the last step until everyone's on the title page. Last one in, add one final thing to the title slide: a link to [[start the game]]. -->
Let's try it out! Designate one "driver" for the moment to do the Setup steps, and follow along with me.

In a nutshell:
* Pull, import, work;
* Publish to File;
* Add, commit, push

And repeat!


## 5. Make a plan with your group!
<!-- FOR NEXT TIME: this is where the handout should go. -->
Basically, have a look at the Group Contract questions in the handout, and talk through them. Be sure you know how to reach each other before you leave today!

You can **write down your proposed plan in the file PROPOSAL.md**; I've added some prompts to that otherwise blank file to show you what I'm looking for.

Your homework is to finish this proposal, so you might as well start while you're all in one place, no?

EXT: If you feel good about your plan in general terms, consider making a shared task list that you can check off. GitHub has some tools for this if you want to explore them, but lo-fi is also fine.


# Homework for next time

* Finish your group proposal if you haven't yet, so you're ready to get working toward a Twine preview by next Tuesday's class.
* Read up on the documentation, watch tutorials, and reverse engineer Twines you enjoy to figure out how to achieve your goals!
* Divide and conquer where you can, and share with each other what you're finding...
