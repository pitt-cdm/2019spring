# Collaborative Unit Workshop

**Work to have done**: a solid attempt at a complete, playable Twine – even if you know there's more you _could_ add.

**Plan for the day**:

1. Workflow Reminder: Describe -> Evaluate -> Suggest (2 min)
2. Evaluation reminder: our shared criteria (5 min)
3. Peer Review Workshop (3 times 10-12 min)
4. Evaluation revisited (10 min)


## 1. Workflow Reminder: Describe -> Evaluate -> Suggest (2 min)
You all know this by now, right? We **evaluate** relative to our criteria, and we make **suggestions** at the end, in light of that evaluation – but we first have to say what it is we think we're evaluating, i.e. we first have to **describe** the project.

For the purposes of this particular project, I think it will be useful to say back the genre or mood that you get from the game: is it horror? humor? drama? tribute? Does it present as fiction, nonfiction, maybe even poetry? Do passages tend toward the long (paragraphs+) or the short (sentences or less)?

## 2. Evaluation reminder: our shared criteria (5 min)
<!-- I'm only including here things that would be visible in a workshop -->

<div class="flex-container">
  <div>
    <header>Baseline Criteria:</header>
    <ul><li>Contain at least 20 passages.</li>
        <li>Have a title screen passage containing at least the story's title, the names of your team members, and a link to a credits page if appropriate.</li>
        <li>Have at least one clearly identifiable ending passage.</li>
        <li>Include at least two passages with diverging paths leading out</li>
        <li>Include at least one passage with converging paths leading in</li>
        <li>As always, use only source material you have fair rights to use (and cite where appropriate).</li>
    </ul>
  </div> <!-- end of baseline -->
  <div>
    <header>Aspirational Inspirations:</header>
    <ul><li>Use visuals to direct attention or advance a claim</li>
        <li>Use sound to convey a sense of place or mood - either by including continuous sound or incidental sound</li>
        <li>Use Twine code or CSS to make at least two new "looks" for selected passages</li>
        <li>Use Twine code to store variables and/or introduce conditional logic (if/then behaviors)</li>
        <li>Have multiple endings (all clearly identifiable)</li>
    </ul>
  </div> <!-- end of aspirational -->
</div> <!-- end of flex-container -->

## 3. Peer Review Workshop (3 times 10-12 min)
Let's do this!

<div class="alert alert-success">
Before you leave your seat, (1) label three <strong>index cards with <em>For: {your team name}</em></strong>; (2) load up your <strong>playable Twine html file</strong> in a web browser (ideally in Chrome or Firefox); and (3) also load up your <strong>project in Twine</strong>, so we can see the code producing that playable game. Leave the cards at your seat.
</div>

For each rotation today, I'm just going to ask that you **find a game you haven't yet played**. Look around and be ready to trade places if someone's stuck with a not-new game.

And <ol><li><strong>Describe</strong> what you see as the focus,</li> <li><strong>Evaluate</strong> where it meets or misses the criteria,</li> and <li><strong>Suggest</strong> ways to meet and exceed the criteria!</li></ol>
Start in the browser, then use the Twine storyboard to help you with steps 2 and 3.

I'll keep track of time.

<!-- first rotation starts 9:50, so end 10:03 -->
<!-- second rotation starts 10:04, so end 10:18 -->
<!-- if third rotation 10:20, end 10:33 -->

## 4. Evaluation revisited (10 min)
Head back to your seats and take a minute to read **and photograph** the notes you've received. (Make sure your photos are legible; I'll be collecting the cards at the end of class.)

Based on your viewing, would anyone like to propose new baseline criteria or share new aspirational goals?


# Homework for Next Time
Tuesday's class (April 16th) will be one more studio for this unit; I'll also give you more formal instructions for the final portfolio and reflection. <!-- Also on Tuesday (or is it Thursday?), I'll give you back all the remaining note cards you filled out for others. -->

The final Twine draft will be due at 11:59 pm Tuesday night.

Thursday, April 18th is our last class meeting – just one week away! We'll use it to compose and share some reflections on the semester.
