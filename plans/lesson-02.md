## Plan for the Day

1. Contract questions?
2. Five Principles, in Brief (15 min)
3. GitHub, part 2  <!-- repo, commit, history, diff --> (15 min)
4. Five Principles as Lenses (15 min)


### 1. Contract questions?
Anyone have any questions about the grading contract, or changes to propose?

### 2. Five Principles, in Brief
We have a couple of new students. Welcome!

Can I get five people to fill them in on the five "principles of new media" from the article I asked you to read? i.e. One person, one term.

<!-- numerical representation, modularity, automation, variability,
and transcoding -->

<!-- If you had to look them up, would you rather use the webtext or the pdf? Why? -->

### 3. GitHub, part 2
Last time, we saw that GitHub can host a discussion forum, so in that sense it's a community website: it makes media social.

But its core functionality is meant to solve a different media problem:

Let's quickly walk through what it looks like:

<!-- TO DO: Add a screenshot here. Or several? -->

# Introduction to GitHub using a basic text file

In this demo, we're going to...

1. Create a new file, and look at how it's displayed
2. Edit it, and talk about commit messages
3. View the file's history and talk about diffs
-->

<!--
My plan:

* use https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/just-say as the text for the file
* demo that linebreaks go away, but we can fix them
* have people suggest some swaps, make the edits
-->


### 4. Five Principles as Lenses

Time to take these abstractions and put them into practice, in two ways:

* practice using GitHub
* practice using our key terms to help us see differently

We'll be working in groups. Can I get four or five volunteers who are feeling good about GitHub to anchor those teams for today? <!-- Nicole, Emma, Margaret, for sure, plus Aba, Jess B, or Laura -->

<div class="alert alert-success">
Head to
<strong><a href="https://classroom.github.com/g/sIXPa5zN">https://classroom.github.com/g/sIXPa5zN</a></strong>, where you'll be asked to create (thanks, anchors!) or join a team.

Then follow the instructions in the README file.
</div>

We'll work for 10-15 minutes, then report back.

## HW for next time:

* **Watch** Git and GitHub for Poets, starting at least with
[the Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV) and going as far as your interest and time allow.
* **Download** software you'll need, as outlined in the [syllabus](/{{site.course.base_url}}uploads)
 - [to use Git at the command line](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03), possibly including Homebrew (on Mac) or GitBash (on Windows)
* *Optional:* If you're feeling intimidated by the command line, try out this [Command Line Crash Course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html)
* *Optional:* Want a more hands-on guide through the full GitHub functionality? See the GitHub Learning Lab entry on our [Resources page](/{{site.course.base_url}}resources).
