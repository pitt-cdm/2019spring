<div class="alert alert-info">I’ll fill in the rest of these lessons and homeworks online, as we go, but here are the essential dates:</div>


<h2 id="unit-3">Unit III: Visual Rhetorics and Argument</h2>
*In this unit, you will make a claim through the juxtaposition of images and text. As with the sound project, the context for your argument is open: you could be making a social commentary, calling for action, constructing a parody, riffing on a pun, explaining a concept, and so on. Whatever you choose, you should consider your audience and what they would find persuasive or interesting, and how you therefore wish to attract and direct their attention.*

Date | What's Due
------ | ------
Tu 2/12	| Visual argument proposal
Th 2/14 |	Visual argument preview
Tu 2/19	| Visual argument full draft
Tu 2/26	| Visual argument final-for-now draft
